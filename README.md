# 420AvorionMods
A compendium of piecemeal standalone Avorion mods.


## Planned Mods:

### Variable Equipment Docks
A simple mod to build upon TheDeadlyShoe's 'More Turrets at Equipment Docks'. Extends the original to add more of all types equips, and a bit of RNG.
  
### Station Immunity
Grants adds immunity to AI stations. Configurable to add the same to player stations.

### Station Cargo Tweak
Adds a minimum amount of cargo bays for world gen. Also configurable to allow more cargo per good.

### Efficiency Up^^^
Makes mining/salvaging turrets able to get efficiency levels above 100%. Adjustable

### Stronger Randoms
Xsotan and Pirate attacks get alot stronger towards 0:0.

### Asteroid Component Condenser
Condenses the breakable parts of asteroids into one single unit block, for the sake of health of multiplayer servers.

### Re-generating Sectors
Sectors with missing stations are re-generated over time. An alternative to SI. Adjustable

### Reinforcements
AI faction sector patrols now respawn. AI ships and stations also now regain health over time.

### More Bosses
Additional bosses similar to Swoks, MEL, and the AI. Farmable for system mods.

### Assasins
Adds scaling, high difficulty, assasination attempts upon the player. Has a configurable %chance to trigger per jump near at-war enemy sectors. No more rampaging in enemy territory with impunity. :}

### Extended Rarities
Adds "Ancient" and "Primal" rarites above legendary rank, with additional features/stats to compliment. Stand alone, but 
strongly benefits from my VED, TEF, and EU mods.

## Turret Enhancement Factory
Adds a rarer end-game variant of turret factories. These take lots of turrets you've already made and improve them into higher rarities in a way that is reproducable. The credit/good consumption is insane, so you'll need to get serious about production.

## The Final Boss
Stronger WHG. Much, much, MUCH stronger WHG. Turns the WHG into the ultimate ultra-end-game raid boss. It'll take everything you've got, and a whole lot more to defeat him. And it comes back stronger every time. :) Caution, you'll want a mod that can provide more resources. Strongly complimented by SR, TEF, MB, and VED.

## Update and overhaul of Lazerwei's Complex3s Mod
Complex3s adds a slick method to create an entire production chain - within a single mega station.
Unfortunately, the original attempted to stack stations onto each other, and was just a lag machine overall.
I aim to fix that.
