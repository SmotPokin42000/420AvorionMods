# 420AvorionMods
A compendium of piecemeal standalone Avorion mods.


## Planned Mods:

### Variable Equipment Docks(VED)
A simple mod to build upon TheDeadlyShoe's 'More Turrets at Equipment Docks'. Extends the original to add more of all types equips, and a bit of RNG.

### Buyable Empty Tokens(BET)
Adds up to one Empty Reconstruction Token to equipment docks at a variable price.
  
### Station Immunity(SI)
Grants adds immunity to AI stations. Configurable to add the same to player stations.

### Truncated Cooldowns(TC)
Adjusts cooldowns on Swoks and the AI to enable quick farming without having to relog. Also alters the cooldown on the wormhole guardian. 

### Efficiency Up^^^(EU)
Makes mining/salvaging turrets able to get efficiency levels above 100%. Adjustable

### Stronger Randoms(SR)
Xsotan and Pirate attacks get alot stronger towards 0:0. Stronger attacks = more salvage. I recommend this in tandem with the Reinforcements(RiF) mod to keep your factions alive.

### Reinforcements(RiF)
AI faction sector patrols now respawn. AI ships and stations also now regain health over time.

### More Bosses(MB)
Additional bosses similar to Swoks, MEL, and the AI. Farmable for system mods.

### Assasins(SASS)
Adds scaling, high difficulty, assasination attempts upon the player. Has a configurable %chance to trigger per jump near at-war enemy sectors. No more rampaging in enemy territory with impunity. :}

### NPC Cargo Tweak(NCT)
Adds a minimum amount of cargo bays for world gen. Also configurable to allow more cargo per good.

### Re-generating Sectors(RgS)
Sectors with missing stations are re-generated over time. An alternative to SI. Adjustable

### Asteroid Component Condenser(ACC)
Condenses the breakable parts of asteroids into one single unit block, for the sake of health of multiplayer servers.

### Station Condenser(SC)
Same idea as ACC, but for stations, and also for the sake of health of multiplayer servers.

### Extended Rarities(ER)
Adds "Ancient" and "Primal" rarites above legendary rank, with additional features/stats to compliment. Stand alone, but 
strongly benefits from my VED, TEF, and EU mods.

## Turret Enhancement Factory(TEF)
Adds a rarer end-game variant of turret factories. These take lots of turrets you've already made and improve them into higher rarities in a way that is reproducable. The credit/good consumption is insane, so you'll need to get serious about production.

## The Final Boss(TFB)
Stronger WHG. Much, much, MUCH stronger WHG. Turns the pathetic old WHG into the ultimate ultra-end-game raid boss. It'll take everything you've got, and a whole lot more to defeat the boss. And it comes back stronger every time. :) Caution, you'll want a mod that can provide more resources. Strongly complimented by SR, TEF, MB, and VED.

## Update and overhaul of Lazerwei's Complex3s Mod
Complex3s adds a slick method to create an entire production chain - within a single mega station.
Unfortunately, the original attempted to stack stations onto each other, and was just a lag machine overall.
I aim to fix that.
